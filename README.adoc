== Couchbase Memcached Mirror

This python module provides a `CouchbaseMemcacheMirror` class which allows
mirroring of data between Couchbase and Memcached. It uses the
https://github.com/pinterest/pymemcache[pymemcache] module for Memcached
access and the https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-python-client[couchbase]
module for Couchbase access.

Since the goal of this module is to introduce Couchbase to those familiar with
Memcached, the module exposes a Memcached-style API (`add`, `set`, `cas`)
rather than a Couchbase one (`insert`, `upsert`).

The class may be used in your code (using a primarily memcached-style API)
to read and write data to and from Memcached and Couchbase. The class will
transparently write to both Couchbase and Memcached clusters.


=== Run as a standalone

[source,sh]
----
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python couchbase_memcache_mirror -C couchbase://10.0.0.99 -M mchost1:11211 -M mchost2:11211
# Value from couchbase: {u'entry': u'Mirror value', u'updated': 1446743031.692772}
# Value from Memcached: {'entry': 'Mirror value', 'updated': 1446743031.692772}
----

=== Use in code
[source,Python]
----
from couchbase_memcache_mirror import CouchbaseMemcacheMirror
mirror = CouchbaseMemcacheMirror(
    couchbase_uri='couchbase://localhost/default',
    memcached_hosts=[('localhost',11211)])

mirror.set('u:couchbase', {'user': 'Couchbase Server'}
value = mirror.get('u:couchbase')
if not value:
    print 'Couldn't retrieve value!'
value['website'] = 'http://couchbase.com'
mirror.replace('u:couchbase', value)
----

See the module source code for more information on implementation and API usage.

=== Primary and secondary data sources

This module allows you to select which data source is a primary for read and write
access. This affects `gets`, `get` and `cas` operations: `get` operations are performed against
the primary and `cas` operations are performed against the primary (the secondary being ignored)
